A local path is structured in the following order: drive letter, colon, backslash, name components separated by backslashes, and a terminating null character. For example, the maximum path on drive D is \"D:\\some 256-character path string<NUL>\" where \"<NUL>\" represents the invisible terminating null character for the current system codepage. (The characters < > are used here for visual clarity and cannot be part of a valid path string.)\r\n\r\nNote  File I/O functions in the Windows API convert \"/\" to \"\\\" as part of converting the name to an NT-style name, except when using the \"\\\\?\\\" prefix as detailed in the following sections.\r\n\r\nThe Windows API has many functions that also have Unicode versions to permit an extended-length path for a maximum total path length of 32,767 characters. This type of path is composed of components separated by backslashes, each up to the value returned in the lpMaximumComponentLength parameter of the GetVolumeInformation function (this value is commonly 255 characters). To specify an extended-length path, use the \"\\\\?\\\" prefix. For example, \"\\\\?\\D:\\very long path\".\r\n\r\nNote  The maximum path of 32,767 characters is approximate, because the \"\\\\?\\\" prefix may be expanded to a longer string by the system at run time, and this expansion applies to the total length.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThis would mean, that if an absolute path is used on Windows, the path should be prefixed with \\\\?\\ to allow a longer path. Otherwise it would fail anyhow.\r\n\r\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/830473 tells about the max length of the commandline itself.\r\n{quote}\r\nOn computers running Microsoft Windows XP or later, the maximum length of the string that you can use at the command prompt is 8191 characters. On computers running Microsoft Windows 2000 or Windows NT 4.0, the maximum length of the string that you can use at the command prompt is 2047 characters.\r\n{quote}","updateAuthor":{"self":"http://jira.codehaus.org/rest/api/2/user?username=rfscholte","name":"rfscholte","emailAddress":"codehaus@sourcegrounds.com","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rfscholte&avatarId=10919","24x24":"http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rfscholte&avatarId=10919","32x32":"http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rfscholte&avatarId=10919","48x48":"http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rfscholte&avatarId=10919"},"displayName":"Robert Scholte","active":true},"created":"2013-09-26T14:43:52.530-0500","updated":"2013-09-26T14:43:52.530-0500"}]},"timeoriginalestimate":null,"aggregatetimespent":null}}
